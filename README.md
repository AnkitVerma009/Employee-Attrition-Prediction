# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
This project predicts employee attrition using a limited number of expert-provided labels. It simulates a real-world scenario where labeling is expensive and restricted. A Subject Matter Expert (SME) provides only 500 labels, and the resulting labeled dataset is used to train a machine learning model to predict which employees are likely to leave.
